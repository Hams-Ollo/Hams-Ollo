### [EVA (EVA 2.0 Multi-Agent System Demo 🤖🔄)](https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/EVA_Demo)
*A smart system where multiple AI "agents" work together, coordinated by a manager.*

This project showcases a smart system where multiple AI "agents" (think of them as specialized AI assistants) work together. It's like having a team of experts, each good at one thing, coordinated by a manager.
This demo uses a technology called **LangGraph** to manage how these AIs work together, deciding who does what and when. It's designed to be efficient and smart in handling your requests.

**Key Features You'll See:**
- **Teamwork Structure (Hierarchical Agents) 🏛️**: A clear manager-and-specialist setup.
- **Smart Task Assignment (Dynamic Routing) 🚦**: The manager AI intelligently sends tasks to the right specialist.
- **Specialists with Superpowers (Tool-Equipped Agents) 🛠️**: Agents use their unique tools to get things done.
- **Quick Responses (Asynchronous Operations) ⚡**: The system can handle multiple things smoothly without getting stuck, making it feel responsive.
- **🧠 Intelligent Memory System**: EVA remembers your conversations! The system maintains context across multiple interactions, allowing for natural follow-up questions and references to previous requests.

## 🌱 Community & Philosophy

Building technology within a community that values technical excellence and human-centered design:

- 📖 **Open Knowledge Sharing**: Repositories designed as educational environments
- 🧑‍🏫 **Inclusive Learning**: Supporting practitioners at all skill levels
- 🔬 **Ethical Innovation**: Integrating ethical considerations into technical decisions
- 🛠️ **Practical Application**: Focusing on real-world implementation over theory
