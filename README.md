**Senior AI Solutions Architect** building production systems for Fortune 500 clients and open-source tools for the rest of us.

Army veteran. Father. 30+ years in contemplative practice. Based in Alachua County, Florida.

I write about the intersection of enterprise technology, ancient wisdom, and what it actually looks like to ship systems that work at [The Zen Solution](https://thezensolution.substack.com).

## What I'm Building

### [Ship It Right](https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/ship-it-right)

**AI-powered production readiness advisor for founders and operators making real AI decisions.**

Ship It Right isn't a chatbot. It's an assessment engine that behaves like a senior solutions architect reviewing your project. Upload your actual documents, tech specs, and architecture diagrams, and it reads your homework before the meeting. The system audits your architecture, data layer, security, and deployment posture in parallel, catches cross-domain conflicts, and synthesizes a cited 90-day action plan grounded in your specific context.

Two paths: the *Production Readiness Assessment* walks builders through the eight domains that determine whether an application survives real users at scale. The *AI Opportunity Assessment* helps business operators identify where AI delivers the highest return without the hand-waving.

Built from patterns I've seen across dozens of enterprise implementations. What separates systems that scale from systems that collapse is almost always problem definition, not technology selection.

### [Open Sousveillance Studio](https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/open-sousveillance-studio)

**AI-powered civic intelligence. Watching from below.**

Multi-agent system that monitors local government activity and alerts citizens to developments that matter. AI scouts watch 15+ government data sources daily, extract actionable intelligence from meeting agendas and permits, and generate reports for community distribution.

Born from environmental advocacy work in my own county. When a permit application threatens your water supply, you shouldn't learn about it after the vote. This is what AI looks like when it's pointed at empowering communities rather than surveilling them.

### [Ollo's Player Companion](https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/Ollos-Player-Companion)

**D&D 5th Edition character sheet with an AI Dungeon Master.**

Full character creation wizard, campaign management, real-time cloud sync, and an AI DM grounded in actual rulebook text. The AI answers rules questions with page citations because it's been fed the PHB, DMG, and Monster Manual. Started as a project for my gaming group. Became a production-grade demonstration of RAG architecture, multi-user sync, and AI integration patterns.

Some of the best communities I've ever been part of were built around games. That experience shaped how I think about building digital products: keep the end user at the heart of everything, build with them rather than just for them.

## Background

**Enterprise AI.** Senior AI Solutions Architect specializing in production-grade multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, and agent orchestration for Fortune 500 clients across aerospace, logistics, retail, and healthcare. I build systems that run in live production environments with human-in-the-loop oversight, self-healing capabilities, and self-improvement loops that optimize based on real-world performance data. The work that matters happens after the demo, when nobody is watching and the system has to hold up at 2 AM.

**Military Medical.** U.S. Army Combat Medic (68W), 4 years active duty with a Forward Reconnaissance Unit plus reserves. Systems coordination, logistics, and leadership under pressure. The military taught me that the quality of your preparation determines the quality of your response when things go wrong, and things always go wrong eventually.

**Contemplative Practice.** 30+ years in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, including time in ashram schools in Vrindavan and Navadwip, India. Daily japa meditation and Sanskrit study. This discipline shapes how I approach technical work in ways that are hard to articulate but impossible to separate from the results. I wrote about it more fully in [The Architecture of Liberation](https://thezensolution.substack.com).

## The Zen Solution

I write about building production AI systems with philosophical depth on [Substack](https://thezensolution.substack.com) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@the_zen_solution).

The through-line across everything I build and write: the best technology creates space for human capability and flourishing rather than extracting from it. Systems that serve liberation rather than dependency. That conviction comes from the Bhagavad Gita, and it shows up in every architectural decision I make whether I name it explicitly or not.
