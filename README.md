- 🤵 Alfred agent specialization patterns
- 🧩 Inter-agent communication protocols
- 🔧 Tool integration examples

## 🌱 Community & Learning

I believe in building technology within a community of practice that values both technical excellence and human-centered design. My repositories are designed to be educational environments where:

- 📖 Knowledge is shared openly and generously
- 🧑‍🏫 Practitioners of all skill levels are welcomed
- 🔬 Experimentation is encouraged and supported
- ⚖️ Ethical considerations are integrated into technical decisions
- 🛠️ Practical application takes precedence over theoretical abstractions

Join me in exploring how AI can augment human capabilities and enhance our collective potential through thoughtful, disciplined implementation.

## 💼 Professional Background

My approach to technology is shaped by diverse experiences:

- **🦅 Military Service**: Former U.S. Army Combat Medic, bringing discipline, leadership, and calm-under-pressure decision making
- **🏥 Healthcare Experience**: Over a decade in emergency and acute care environments, developing empathy and crisis response
- **💻 Enterprise Tech**: Building and deploying AI solutions at scale for global organizations
- **🧘‍♂️ Disciplined Practice**: Daily meditation, martial arts, and focused training informing system design principles

This background gives me a unique perspective on building technology that serves human needs while maintaining robustness and reliability.
