## What I'm Building

### [Ship It Right](https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/ship-it-right) *(Coming Soon)*
**Technical clarity for founders and operators making AI decisions.**

Two paths: The *Production Readiness* assessment walks builders through the eight domains that determine whether an application survives real users at scale. The *AI Opportunity Assessment* helps business operators identify where artificial intelligence delivers the highest return.

Built from patterns I've seen across Fortune 500 implementations. What separates systems that scale from systems that collapse.

### [Open Sousveillance Studio](https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/open-sousveillance-studio)
**AI-powered civic intelligence. Watching from below.**

Multi-agent system that monitors local government activity and alerts citizens to developments that matter. AI scouts watch 15+ government data sources daily, extract actionable intelligence from meeting agendas and permits, and generate reports for community distribution.

Born from environmental advocacy work in my own county. When a permit application threatens your water supply, you shouldn't learn about it after the vote.

### [Ollo's Player Companion](https://github.com/Hams-Ollo/Ollos-Player-Companion)
**D&D 5th Edition character sheet with an AI Dungeon Master.**

Full character creation wizard, campaign management, real-time cloud sync, and an AI DM grounded in actual rulebook text. The AI answers rules questions with page citations because it's been fed the PHB, DMG, and Monster Manual.

Started as a project for my gaming group. Became a production-grade demonstration of RAG architecture, multi-user sync, and AI integration patterns.

## Background

**Enterprise AI:** Senior AI Solutions Architect specializing in enterprise-grade AI systems. I process high-volume agent requests and orchestrate complex workflows for thousands of users in live production environments. Working with dozens of clients across aerospace, logistics, global retail, and healthcare, I build multi-agentic solutions featuring human-in-the-loop oversight and self-healing capabilities. My architectures are rooted in real-world metrics, establishing self-improvement loops that optimize performance autonomously based on live production data.

**Military Medical:** U.S. Army Combat Medic (68W), 4 years active + reserves. 3rd Infantry Division, Forward Reconnaissance Unit. Systems coordination, logistics, leadership under pressure.

**Spiritual Practice:** 30+ years in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, including years in ashrams in India. 3:30 AM wake-ups, daily meditation, Sanskrit study. This discipline shapes how I approach technical work.

## The Zen Solution

I write about integrating ancient wisdom with technical practice on [Substack](https://substack.com/@thezensolution) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@the_zen_solution).

Core conviction: the best technology creates space for human flourishing rather than extracting from it.
